If you are brand new to yoga, there are certain postures that are essential for you to learn so you can feel comfortable in a class or practicing on your own at home.

It’s not easy to narrow everything down since there are over 300 positions in the physical yoga (asana) practice, but these poses can start you off on the right path. If you do each one of these for 5-10 breaths, it also creates a great beginner’s yoga program for you to do every day.
3 most important yoga poses for beginners. Note: You don't have to be able to do all these poses exactly as pictured — ALWAYS listen to your body and modify if needed.</p><br>
